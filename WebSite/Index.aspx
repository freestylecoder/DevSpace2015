		<h1>Keynote Speaker</h1>
		<p>
			We are extremely pleased to announce that Alan Stevens will be the keynote speaker for DevSpace.
			Alan is a talented and passionate speaker with a strong commitment to community.
			We are thrilled that he will share his passion with you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not only will Alan deliver our keynote, he has agreed to facilitate our open spaces.
			For those not familiar with the open spaces concept, the open spaces are a dedicated area of the conference that allows people to start or continue conversations on topics of interest.
			Guided by the law of two feet, people are free to enter and participate in the conversation at their own will.
			Once they have contributed or received what they look for, they are free to leave at their own will.
			Alan will be there to help facilitate these conversation with whatever the group needs.
