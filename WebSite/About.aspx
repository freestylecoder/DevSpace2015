		<h1>About DevSpace 2015</h1>
		<p>
			DevSpace 2015 is the first of what will be annual developer’s conference to take place in Huntsville, Alabama.
			Fueled by extensive space and missile research and a vibrant, emerging start-up culture, Huntsville is a market poised and ready to burst onto the national stage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technological interests run the gamut of every language.
			As such, DevSpace aims to cater to this entire atmosphere.
			DevSpace wants to offer talks on a variety of languages, offering attendees the ability to improve their skills within their daily technology of choice and the ability to become familiar with new technologies.
			Combine this with talks on soft skills and processes, DevSpace will provide an outstanding value to the attendees.
		</p>
		<p>
			DevSpace will operate on a Friday and Saturday.
			We think this schedule will encourage employers to send their employees to the conference.
			The schedule is based on the idea of “Give a day, take a day.”
			The employers are more likely to give their staff a day from work, knowing the employee with give a day of their own, doubling their return on investment.

		<h1>About DevSpace Huntsville</h1>
		<p>
			DevSpace Huntsville is the brain child of Chris Gardner.
			Chris has spent years speaking at conferences and users groups all over the country.
			As he fell in love with the culture and community offered by these events, he began to wonder why such an event didn’t exist in his area.
		</p>
		<p>
			After years of talking about creating a conference, he finally decided to put his money where his mouth was.
			Enlisting local volunteers that shared his passion, DevSpace Huntsville was officially registered as an Alabama Non-Profit Corporation.
			We are currently in the process of completing the paperwork to register as a full 501(c)(3) Educational Non-Profit entity.
